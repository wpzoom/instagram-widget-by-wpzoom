== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a new Instagram feed? =

Creating an Instagram feed is easy:
1. Go to **Instagram Widget → Connect** in your WordPress dashboard
2. Connect your Instagram Business or Creator account
3. Go to **Instagram Widget → Feeds** and click "Add New"
4. Customize your feed settings and save
5. Copy the shortcode or use the Gutenberg block to embed your feed

= What type of Instagram account do I need? =

Due to Instagram API requirements, you need an **Instagram Business or Creator account** to connect. Personal Instagram accounts are no longer supported by Instagram's API. Converting to a Business or Creator account is free and takes just a few minutes in the Instagram app.

= How do I display my Instagram feed in Elementor? =

You can display your Instagram feed in Elementor in two ways:
1. Use the dedicated **WPZOOM Instagram** Elementor widget
2. Use a Shortcode widget and paste your feed's shortcode

= Can I display multiple Instagram accounts? =

Yes! With the **[PRO version](https://www.wpzoom.com/plugins/instagram-widget/)**, you can connect multiple Instagram accounts and display feeds from different accounts anywhere on your site. You can also combine posts from multiple accounts into a single unified feed - perfect for brands with multiple Instagram profiles.

= How can I improve my page load speed with Instagram feeds? =

Enable the **AJAX Initial Load** option in your feed settings. This loads the Instagram feed content asynchronously after your page renders, dramatically improving initial page load time. Visitors will see an elegant skeleton placeholder with a shimmer animation while the feed loads in the background.

= What are Instagram Insights and how do I access them? =

Instagram Insights is a **PRO feature** that lets you track your Instagram performance directly from WordPress. You can monitor follower growth, reach, impressions, engagement, and individual post performance with interactive charts. To use Insights, you need a Business or Creator account connected via Facebook.
